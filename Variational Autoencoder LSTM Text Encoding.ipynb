    "# LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder for Text Encoding\n",
    "In this notebook I will demo the LSTM-based variational autoencoder (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) I wrote in Keras for encoding text to a latent vector representation. This representation can be used for computing similarity metrics between documents (sentences, in this case) or as a feature vector for other learning tasks.\n",

    "The VAE is a generative model that maximizes the marginal probability of the input by conditioning it on a latent variable whose distribution is learned by a parameterized function estimator, such as a neural network. The neural network samples z from a normal distribution and transforms it to a distribution Q(z|X) to give us a distribution of z values given X which are likely to produce X. This is where the \"Variational\" part of VAE's comes in: we use KL-divergence in our loss function to drive Q(z|X) as close as we can to P(z), the prior distribution of z. The loss function also includes a reconstruction error term. In summary, the VAE learns an encoding distribution Q which produces latent representations z which are likely to produce the input data X, and a decoding function f(z) which is optimized to output data as close to X as it can from the latent representation."

    "We would want to dig in more deeply than this cursory glance at example sentences, but it seems that our VAE encodings capture some sentence structure but are not as good at capturing topics or meaning. It may be that if we used a more sophisticated weighted average of the word embeddings to represent the sentences we could yield better content-based similarity without having to use a complicated model like the VAE. Our doc2vec model seemed to be a reasonable approach as well - given a larger corpus we would expect it to give better embeddings. We could also try using a Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder to explicitly model topic information in our latent representation of the sentences.\n",
